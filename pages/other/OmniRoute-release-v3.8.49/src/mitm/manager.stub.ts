// a safe degraded value return it (getCachedPassword/setCachedPassword/clearCachedPassword
// → null/no-op, getAllAgentsStatus → empty list, getMitmStatus → stopped status) because
// MITM needs host access the container lacks. startMitm/stopMitm still throw since they
// cannot do anything meaningful without the real MITM process. Routes that need real MITM
// at runtime dynamic-import @/mitm/manager.runtime (the real module) instead.
// Fix #3390: getMitmStatus no longer throws — it returns running=false so the AgentBridge
// UI shows a graceful "stopped" state instead of an error banner in Docker.
