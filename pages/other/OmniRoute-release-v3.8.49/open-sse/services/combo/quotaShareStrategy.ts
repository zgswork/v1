/**
 * quotaShareStrategy.ts — Dedicated selection strategy for quota-share combos.
 *
 * Activated ONLY for the internal "quota-share" strategy (the auto-minted qtSd/
 * combos). It is never imported by generic combo routing paths, so tuning this
 * module can never regress the existing strategies (fill-first, p2c, headroom…).
 *
 * Three mechanisms are applied in sequence:
 *
 *   1. Per-model bucket gating (accountBuckets.isBucketSaturated):
 *      A connection whose 5h, 7d, or per-model 7d:<model> window is saturated
 *      for the requested model is moved to a DEPRIORITIZED tail rather than
 *      dropped. If EVERY connection is saturated, all are eligible again
 *      (fail-open: a quota-share combo is never hard-blocked here).
 *
 *   2. DRR (Deficit Round Robin):
 *      Among the eligible connections, each round adds a quantum proportional to
 *      the target weight to that target's deficit, then selects the target with
 *      the largest accumulated deficit and zeroes it. Over many requests this
 *      distributes load proportionally to weight, deterministically.
 *
 *   3. P2C (Power of Two Choices) over real in-flight load:
 *      Between the top two DRR candidates, the one with fewer active in-flight
 *      requests (quotaShareInflight) wins; ties keep the DRR order. The winner's
 *      in-flight counter is incremented immediately and a decrement callback is
 *      returned for the caller's finally/abort handler.
 *
 * All state is in-process; no DB or network calls. The clock is injectable
 * (the `nowMs` param) so unit tests are fully deterministic.
 *
 * Part of: Quota Sharing Engine — Phase 3 (#9 dedicated quota-share strategy).
