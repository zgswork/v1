/**
 * Issue #2247 — disambiguation of the Qoder OAuth/CLI vs API-key error
 * surface in the provider test route. These tests cover the small helper
 * extracted from src/app/api/providers/[id]/test/route.ts (`hasQoderToken`)
 * to confirm the new branching logic.
 *
 * We intentionally keep this as a focused unit test of the helper rather
 * than spinning up the full route, because the route handler runs SQLite
 * migrations + the OAuth refresh path which require an isolated DATA_DIR
 * and are covered elsewhere.
