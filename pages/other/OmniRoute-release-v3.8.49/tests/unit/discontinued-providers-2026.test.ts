// confirmed gone have hasFree flipped to false so the dashboard / onboarding no longer advertises a
// free tier that does not exist. The budget catalog already dropped them. The 2026-06-18 batch
// (gitlawb, gitlawb-gmi, aimlapi, yi) was each re-verified against the official source before flipping
// (aimlapi docs: "The Free Tier is currently paused"; gitlawb GitHub issue #1345: MiMo revoked).
