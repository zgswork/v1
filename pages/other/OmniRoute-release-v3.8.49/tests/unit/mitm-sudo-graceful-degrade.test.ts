/**
 * Regression test for MITM cert install in Docker `USER node` (non-root, no sudo).
 *
 * OmniRoute's runtime Docker image (`Dockerfile`) runs as `USER node` (UID 1000)
 * and the slim base (`node:24-trixie-slim`) does NOT ship `sudo`. The previous
 * `execFileWithPassword("sudo", ["-S", ...])` would spawn `sudo` unconditionally
 * when not root, producing `spawn sudo ENOENT` and breaking `installCert` /
 * `addDNSEntries` for any MITM operation triggered from inside the container.
 *
 * The fix:
 *  - `isSudoAvailable()` probes `PATH` for `sudo`.
 *  - `execFileWithPassword` when invoked with `command === "sudo"` and sudo is
 *    NOT available and the process is NOT root, strips the leading `sudo -S`
 *    flags and runs the underlying command directly (same user, no elevation).
 *  - Callers that absolutely require elevation (e.g. installing a CA to the
 *    system trust store) can pre-check with `isSudoAvailable()` and skip with
 *    a clear log instead of throwing.
 *
 * This mirrors upstream behavior (decolua/9router) extended to OmniRoute's TS
 * fork and OmniRoute's existing root-detection (`isRoot()`).
