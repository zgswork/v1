/**
 * Regression test for #3641 — `execFileText` produces a doubled
 * "Command failed: Command failed: ..." prefix in error messages.
 *
 * Node's `execFile` already sets `error.message` to
 * "Command failed: <command>" when the child process exits non-zero.
 * `execFileText` was prepending its own "Command failed: " prefix on top of
 * that, producing the doubled string.
 *
 * The fix: surface `getErrorMessage(error)` directly (Node's message already
 * contains the command), only appending stderr when it is non-empty.
 *
 * Uses the current Node binary with an exit(1) snippet as the deterministic
 * failing command. This triggers "Command failed: ..." in Node's error.message;
 * ENOENT from a missing binary uses "spawn ... ENOENT" instead, so it never
 * doubles.
