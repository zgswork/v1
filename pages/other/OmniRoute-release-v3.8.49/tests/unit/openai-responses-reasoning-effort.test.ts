/**
 * Reasoning-effort mapping across the OpenAI Chat <-> Responses request translators.
 *
 * Chat Completions carries the reasoning hint as top-level `reasoning_effort`; the
 * Responses API nests it as `reasoning.effort`. These tests pin both directions so
 * the hint survives when a request crosses formats (e.g. a Responses client routed
 * to an OpenAI-native Chat Completions upstream).
 *
 * Ported from upstream PR https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/1817 (ryanngit).
 * Adapted: OmniRoute previously promoted `reasoning.effort` only behind the
 * Copilot-client gate (commit 75d9a83c25), which silently dropped the field for
 * every other Responses client (OpenCode, Cursor, raw OpenAI Responses, ...).
 * This test pins the unconditional promotion of effort while keeping the
 * Copilot-only `summary` -> Claude thinking marker behind its existing gate.
