/**
 * Codex multi-account family-revocation cascade — quota-sync trigger.
 *
 * The Quota / Providers dashboard (POST /api/usage/provider-limits ->
 * syncAllProviderLimits, and GET /api/usage/[connectionId]) calls
 * refreshAndUpdateCredentials() for each connection, in chunks of N CONCURRENT.
 * For rotating-refresh providers (Codex/OpenAI share one Auth0 client_id) a
 * single-use refresh_token is rotated on every refresh; refreshing several
 * sibling accounts concurrently makes Auth0 revoke the WHOLE token family
 * (openai/codex#9648) -> every account but the last dies with `[403] <!DOCTYPE`.
 *
 * On the affected VM expires_at is persisted as ~0, so needsRefresh() is
 * effectively always true -> every codex account gets refreshed on every page
 * visit -> guaranteed cascade.
 *
 * Fix: refreshAndUpdateCredentials must NEVER proactively rotate the
 * refresh_token of a rotating-refresh provider. The quota fetch reuses the
 * current access_token (multi-day) and genuine expiry is handled by the
 * reactive, serialized 401 path during real requests. Non-rotating providers
 * must keep refreshing proactively (no over-broadening).
